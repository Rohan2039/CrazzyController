# CrazzyController
~~Software for Hardware~~ Software is a Hardware.

This repo demonstrates the use case of the volatile keyword through a device driver example.

**Files Overview:**
1. Driver.o // This is the driver code which is incomplete.
2. TransmitConfirmation.c // write this txconfirmation function to make driver code complete
3. crazycontroller // executable file which mimics hardware.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Write the TransmitConfirmation.c file as outlined.
2. Run following command.
   
    i. gcc -O3 -o TransmitConfirmation.o -c TransmitConfirmation.c  //which compiles .c file and optimizes it
    ii. gcc Driver.o TransmitConfirmation.o -o Driver //which links both Driver.o and TransmitConfirmation.o object files and creats an executable file.
4. Open two terminals:
5. Run ./crazycontroller command in one terminal.
6. Run ./Driver command in the other.
7. Modify the pointer in TransmitConfirmation.c to volatile, recompile, and rerun.

**Observation** 
1. With a non-volatile pointer, the while loop does not terminate.
2. With a volatile pointer, the code executed as expected.

But why !!!
